Districts of Uganda

npm install districts-uganda

This package returns a promise. Therefore to access the district names, you will have to:

- require the package i.e const names = require('ug-districts')

- then names.path.then(districts => districts.map(d => console.log(d))).catch(error => console.log(error))

\*\* Have fun with it.
